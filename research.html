<h2>Bay Area Spanish</h2>
<p>My work on Bay Area Spanish focuses on the production and perception of vowels, and how both can be affected by experience with bilingualism.</p><br>

<h2>Bilingualism in Catalonia</h2>
<p>My research in bilingualism in Catalonia centers on the production of vowels in Spanish and in Catalan. According to the Speech Learning Model, bilinguals have a shared L1-L2 phonological inventory. When phonological categories are perceived to overlap, they may assimilate to one another, forming a composite category. Conversely, categories may undergo dissimilation, whereby they may be produced in a nonnative-like manner to preserve distinction. I investigate changes in the vowel space over time in order to observe outcomes of language contact and the social and linguistic factors that mediate this change.</p><br>
